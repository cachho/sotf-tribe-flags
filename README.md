# Introduction
Hello, I always was a fan of tribe flags, for me they were a unique way to customize your game. This love eventually made me think about creating a tribe flag pack. What i like about tribe flags is that they are visible to your tribe mates in the lobby and all players ingame. They can be used to show-off and comply with your tribe name to have a fun experience. 
*All flags are cropped individually and are individually optimized for ARK ingame*. 
Last but not least 350 flags only take ~20mb on your hard drive! So the more flags we get, the better! And they are super easy to install.

# Download
Check releases: https://github.com/cachho/sotf-tribe-flags/releases

# How to install
First, dowload the pack from the link above. Again, only 19mb. Unarchive the content in your SOTF folder. The path should look like this: 

`[your steam folder]\steamapps\common\ARK SOTF\ShooterGame\Saved\MyPaintings` 

You should now have .pnt files in there. Now you are ready to go ingame.

# How to update

Delete everything in your "MyPaintings"-Folder, unless you have your own flags. If you do so save them to a different place. Then do a fresh install as described above. If you have your own flags, drag them in the folder now. This methods avoids having the same flag twice if the name changes. 

Also if you have nothing to do with a certain category, let's say Clash of Clans, you can just look for the word "CLASH" in your files and delete those.

# Ingame

In the lobby you go in your tribemanager, select tribe flags. Now you have 2 options. With `load` you can preview a tribe flag. It has no loading time, but to choose a flag, you have to click `set tribeflag`. This will have a long loading time so preview before.

# The making and the future
I hope you enjoy my pack. I can not have everybodies favorites so suggest them in the comments and i will add them in an update. Thanks for reading through. Sadly you can not mix colors in ARK, so one of the basic colors has to be selected for everything. That causes problems with skin tones. If any skins don't work tell me in the comments, it will be fixed next update, I did not get to test all ingame yet. Thanks for your support, upvote if you like it.
